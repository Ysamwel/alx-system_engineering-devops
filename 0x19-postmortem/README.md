# Post-Mortem Analysis: Web Stack Debugging Outage

## Overview

This repository contains the post-mortem analysis of a recent web stack debugging outage. The analysis includes a detailed timeline, root cause identification, resolution steps, and corrective and preventative measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.

## Issue Summary

**Duration of the Outage:**
- **Start Time:** June 1, 2024, 14:00 UTC
- **End Time:** June 1, 2024, 16:30 UTC

**Impact:**
- The main website was down, causing significant disruptions. Users experienced 500 Internal Server Errors.
- Approximately 85% of users were affected, with the remaining 15% on unaffected cached pages.

**Root Cause:**
- The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the Nginx server settings, which led to a failure in load balancing between the web servers.

## Timeline

- **14:00 UTC** - Issue detected by automated monitoring alert indicating a spike in 500 errors.
- **14:05 UTC** - Initial investigation started by the on-call engineer, reviewing server logs and application performance metrics.
- **14:15 UTC** - Assumption made that the issue was related to a recent deployment; rolled back the deployment, but the issue persisted.
- **14:30 UTC** - Misleading investigation paths: focused on database performance and network latency, which showed no abnormalities.
- **15:00 UTC** - Escalated to the DevOps team for further investigation.
- **15:30 UTC** - DevOps identified misconfiguration in Nginx settings causing the load balancer to fail.
- **15:45 UTC** - Configuration updated to correct settings.
- **16:00 UTC** - Nginx server restarted, monitoring for stability.
- **16:30 UTC** - Services fully restored and confirmed stable.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause

The root cause was traced back to a recent configuration change in the Nginx server settings. Specifically, an incorrect parameter in the load balancing configuration led to all traffic being directed to a single, overloaded web server. This caused the server to become unresponsive and resulted in 500 Internal Server Errors for the majority of users.

### Resolution

To resolve the issue, the DevOps team undertook the following steps:
1. **Identified Configuration Error:** Examined the Nginx configuration files and pinpointed the incorrect load balancing parameter.
2. **Updated Configuration:** Corrected the misconfiguration by setting the appropriate load balancing parameters.
3. **Restarted Nginx Server:** Restarted the Nginx server to apply the new configuration.
4. **Monitored System Performance:** Continuously monitored the web server performance to ensure the issue was fully resolved and no further errors were occurring.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements/Fixes

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures are recommended:
1. **Implement Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate and version control server configurations.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Add detailed monitoring for Nginx configuration changes and immediate alerts for any misconfigurations detected.
3. **Load Balancer Redundancy:** Implement redundancy in the load balancer setup to ensure that traffic can be rerouted in case of a single point of failure.

### Tasks to Address the Issue

1. **Patch Nginx Server:** Ensure all Nginx servers are running the latest stable version with security patches.
2. **Add Monitoring on Server Memory:** Implement memory usage monitoring on web servers to detect and alert on high usage.
3. **Review and Update Documentation:** Update the internal documentation to reflect the correct Nginx configuration settings and best practices.
4. **Conduct Training:** Provide additional training for engineers on identifying and resolving configuration-related issues.
5. **Run Regular Audits:** Schedule regular audits of server configurations to catch any potential misconfigurations before they cause issues.
